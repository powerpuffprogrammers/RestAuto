The SWE application code and documentation is stored on github located at:  https://github.com/powerpuffprogrammers
The SWE application website is: https://sites.google.com/site/sweservewithease/home

In order to run our application, the following steps should be taken after moving the code to a Java IDE for example, eclipse. 
Run databaseAController.java, databaseBController.java, databaseCController.java
Run messageController.java
Run TabletApp.java
This should open up the login screen. On each tablet, only the TabletApp.java file will be needed to run the SWE application.

In order to demo our application at this time, we have hardcoded some login IDs for your convenience. 
0->waiter
1->manager
2->chef
3->host
